/**
 * Hook to handle authentication based on app state changes.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This hook ONLY logs out users when:
 * 1. The app was completely killed (not just backgrounded)
 * 2. AND more than 4 minutes passed since it was killed
 * 
 * When the app is in background (tablet screen off, home screen, etc.),
 * the user will STAY LOGGED IN forever - no matter how long.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * - When app goes to background: Store timestamp AND set cold start flag
 * - When app comes back from background: Clear both (app was NOT killed)
 * - On app startup: If cold start flag exists AND timestamp > 4min, logout
 *   The cold start flag being present means the app was killed while in background
